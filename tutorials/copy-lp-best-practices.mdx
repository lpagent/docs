## Key Success Factors

### 1. Research Token Preferences

**Token selection has a huge impact on profitability.** Before copying any wallet, conduct quick research on their trading style:

- **Small Cap vs Big Cap**: Analyze whether the original wallet typically invests in small-cap tokens (higher risk/reward) or big-cap tokens (more stable)
- **Market Focus**: Determine if they focus on specific sectors or trade across various token categories

### 2. Implement Risk Management

**There are always opportunities, so protect your capital first.** Setting proper safeguards is crucial:

- **Rug Check**: Always enable rug pull protection to avoid honeypot tokens
- **Minimum Market Cap**: 3M minimum market cap
- **Jupiter Organic Score**: 50 or higher

### 3. Analyze Trading Patterns

**Position timing significantly affects Copy LP performance.** Study the original LP's behavior:

- **Entry Speed**: Some traders "ape in" and exit very quickly, causing lag issues for copy trading
- **Position Duration**: Look for traders who typically hold positions for **20+ minutes**

### 4. Use Stop Loss Protection

**Stop Loss (SL) is an excellent way to protect your capital:** I usually set it as **15%**

### 5. Start Small and Scale Gradually

**Begin with minimal capital and increase as you gain confidence:**
Recommended Approach:

1. **Testing Phase**: Start with 1-5% of your intended investment
2. **Learning Phase**: Copy for 1-2 weeks to understand the wallet's patterns
3. **Optimization Phase**: Fine-tune settings based on performance data

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Copying without research**: Never blindly copy a wallet based on recent performance alone
2. **Ignoring risk settings**: Always prioritize capital protection over potential gains
3. **Starting too large**: Resist the urge to deploy significant capital immediately
4. **Not monitoring performance**: Regularly review and adjust your Copy LP strategies
5. **Chasing quick gains**: Focus on consistent, long-term profitability
