## How to Copy a Wallet

Follow these steps to start copying a successful LP:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Wallet to Copy">
    Browse the Portfolio Leaderboard or explore user profiles to find wallets
    with performance metrics you like.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Copy'">

    </Frame>
    Set up your copy parameters:
    - **Copy Percentage:** Allocate a percentage of value you want to copy
    - **Max Amount:** Set a maximum total value (in SOL or USDC) that this copy strategy can use.
    - **Take Profit (TP):** Automatically stop copying and secure profits when the copied position reaches a certain % gain.
    - **Stop Loss (SL):** Automatically stop copying to limit potential losses if the copied position reaches a certain % loss.

    Example:
    - Your settings: **Copy 50%, Max amount $30**
    - If original wallet: Open a position `$20`, you open a position worth `$10` (`$20*50% = $10`)
    - If original wallet: Open a position `$100`, you open a position worth `$30` (`$100*50% = $50` but it is bigger than Max Amount, so Max Amount is used)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Copying">
    Confirm your settings and activate the copy trade. LP Agent will now
    automatically replicate the selected wallet's LP actions within your defined
    parameters.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Configuration Details

- **Proportional Copying:** Trades are typically copied proportionally based on the percentage you allocate relative to the copied wallet's size and your available capital.
- **Risk Management:** TP and SL settings apply specifically to your copied position, allowing you to manage risk independently.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** LP Agent monitors the source wallet and automatically adjusts your copied position when they make changes (e.g., rebalancing, adding/removing liquidity), respecting your max amount and risk settings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How exactly does copying work?">
    When you copy a wallet, LP Agent monitors the source wallet's LP actions on
    supported protocols (Orca, Meteora). When they open, close, or modify a
    position, our system automatically replicates that action in your account,
    scaled according to your settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I copy more than one wallet?">
    Yes, you can copy multiple wallets simultaneously, allocating different
    amounts or percentages of your capital to each, as long as you have
    sufficient funds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are opening and closing positions handled when copying?">
    When the source wallet opens a new position, LP Agent will automatically
    perform a "zap-in" transaction for you using your chosen base token
    (typically SOL or USDC) to create the equivalent position according to your
    copy settings (percentage, max amount). Similarly, when the source wallet
    closes a position, LP Agent will automatically "zap-out" your corresponding
    position, converting the assets back to your base token.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the wallet I'm copying changes their strategy?">
    Your copied position will automatically follow the changes made by the
    source wallet, provided the actions align with your configured settings (Max
    Amount, TP, SL).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there extra fees for using the Copy LP feature?">
    Please refer to our standard [Fee Structure](/fee) documentation. The usual
    zap-in/zap-out fees apply if single-token operations are required to
    replicate trades. There are no specific *additional* fees just for copying.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I stop copying a wallet?">
    You can stop copying any wallet at any time through your dashboard. Go to
    your "Copy LP" section, select the active copy, and choose the "Disable"
    option.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the risks involved in Copy LP Trading?">
    While Copy LP Trading allows you to leverage the expertise of others, it
    still involves risks. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
    The wallet you copy might make poor decisions, or market conditions could
    change rapidly. Always use the risk management tools (SL/TP, Max Amount) and
    only invest capital you can afford to lose.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I set a Take Profit (TP) or Stop Loss (SL) on my copied position?">
    Your copied position will be closed or adjusted based on whichever condition
    is met first: either your predefined TP/SL level is reached, or the wallet
    you are copying takes an action (e.g., closes their position). This ensures
    your risk management settings are respected while still following the source
    wallet's activity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Copy LP Trading is a powerful tool, but it's important to understand the risks
  and configure your settings carefully.
