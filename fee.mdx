## Our Fee Structure

LP Agent maintains a simple and transparent fee structure to ensure you always know exactly what you're paying.

<Note>
  We only charge 8% on your actual earnings - no upfront costs, no swap fees.
  You only pay when you earn!

### Fee Structure

Our pricing model is simple: you only pay when you earn.

**Example:** You open a position on SOL/USDC with any amount - there's no swap fee charged when entering or exiting the position.

**Example:** When you claim your position fee, LP Agent takes 8% as a claimed fee. If you don't claim any position fee, you pay nothing at all.
