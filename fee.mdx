## Our Fee Structure

LP Agent maintains a simple and transparent fee structure to ensure you always know exactly what you're paying.

<Note>
  We only charge a small fee when a swap is required during entry or exit -
  there are no hidden fees or ongoing management charges.
</Note>

### Transaction Fees

A small fee is applied only when a swap is necessary to facilitate your transaction.

**Example:** If you Zap-In to a SOL/USDC pool using only SOL, no swap is needed, and thus no fee is charged by LP Agent. However, if you Zap-In using USDT, a swap from USDT to SOL and/or USDC is required, and the 0.3% fee applies.
